This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
cities.df <- read.csv(paste(file = "Cities42.csv", sep = " "))
View(cities.df)
```

##summarze the data
```{r}

library(psych)
describe(cities.df)
```
##dimensions of dataset
```{r}
dim(cities.df)
```
##To get clear visualization by city name.
```{r}
table(cities.df$CityName)
```
##one-way contingency tables for the categorical variables in your dataset.:-

```{r}

## Correlation matrix

```{r}
cor.df <- cities.df[, c(2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,12,18)]
cor(cor.df)
```
# RoomRent and istouristdestination, starRating, hotelCapacity are highly correlated. So prices peak due to these factors. RoomRent and population,IsMetroCity are negatively correlated.  

## OLS model
```{r}
# OLS Model
fit<- glm(RoomRent ~HasSwimmingPool+IsNewYearEve+IsTouristDestination+IsMetroCity+StarRating+Airport+HotelCapacity+FreeWifi+FreeBreakfast, data = cities.df)
summary(fit)
```

```{r}
par(mfrow= c(1,2))
plot(cities.df$RoomRent ~ cities.df$Airport, ylim= c(100 , 75000) , xlim=c(1,50) , main="RoomRent vs Airport")
```

```{r}

plot(cities.df$RoomRent ~ cities.df$StarRating , main= " RoomRent vs Starrating" ,ylab= "Room Rent" , xlab="StarRating")
```

## cor test between RoomRent and IsTouristDestnation
```{r}
cor.test(cities.df$RoomRent,cities.df$IsTouristDestination)
```

## Cor test between StarRating and RoomRent

```{r}

```

## T- test between RoomRent and HasSwimmingPool
2 Tail test
Ho:-There is no significant difference between the Room Rent of Hotels with swimmin pool and hotels without swimmin pool
H1:-There is a significant difference between the Room Rent of Hotels with swimmin pool and hotels without swimmin pool

```{r}
t.test(cities.df$RoomRent[cities.df$HasSwimmingPool==0],cities.df$RoomRent[cities.df$HasSwimmingPool==1])
```

Inference: Since p value < .05, we reject null hypothesis H0 and accept that there is a significant difference bewtween the RoomRent of hotels with swimming pool and hotels without swimming pool.

## T-test between RoomRent and FreeWifi
Ho:-There is no significant difference between the Room Rent of Hotels providing free wifi and those which do not
H1:-There is a significant difference between the Room Rent of Hotels providing free wifi and those which do not

```{r}
t.test(cities.df$RoomRent[cities.df$FreeWifi==0],cities.df$RoomRent[cities.df$FreeWifi==1])
```

## T-test between RoomRent and FreeBreakfast
Ho: There is no significant difference between the Room Rent of Hotels with free breakfast and hotels without free breakfast.
H1: There is a significant difference between the Room Rent of Hotels with free breakfast and hotels without free breakfast

```{r}
t.test(cities.df$RoomRent[cities.df$FreeBreakfast==0],cities.df$RoomRent[cities.df$FreeBreakfast==1])
```

Inference: Since p-value>0.05, we accept H0,hence, There is no significant difference between the Room Rent of Hotels with free breakfast and hotels without free breakfast.

## T-test between RoomRent and IsNewYearEve
Ho: There is no significant difference between the Room Rent of Hotels on normal Eve and New Year’s Eve.
H1: The Room Rents of Hotels on normal Eve are cheaper than that on New Year’s Eve

```{r}
t.test(cities.df$RoomRent[cities.df$IsNewYearEve==0],cities.df$RoomRent[cities.df$IsNewYearEve==1],alternative = "less")
```

Inference: Since p-value<0.05, we accept H1,hence,the Room Rents of Hotels on normal Eve are cheaper than that on New Year’s Eve.

## T-test between RoomRent and IsWeekend
Ho:-There is no significant difference between the Room Rent of Hotels on weekdays and weekends.
H1:-There is a significant difference between the Room Rent of Hotels on weekdays and weekends.

```{r}
t.test(cities.df$RoomRent[cities.df$IsWeekend==0],cities.df$RoomRent[cities.df$IsWeekend==1])
```

Inference:-Since p-vale>0.05, we accept Ho,hence there is no significant difference between the Room Rent of Hotels on weekdays and weekends.

## T-test between RoomRent and IsTouristDestination
Ho: There is no significant difference between the Room Rent of Hotels in Tourist destinations and non tourist destinations.
H1: The Room Rents of Hotels in Tourist destinations are greater than that in non tourist destinations

```{r}
t.test(cities.df$RoomRent[cities.df$IsTouristDestination==0],cities.df$RoomRent[cities.df$IsTouristDestination==1],alternative = "less")
```

Inference: Since p-value<0.05, we accept H1,hence,the Room.Rents of Hotels in Tourist destinations are greater than that in non tourist destinations

## T-test between RoomRent and IsMetroCity
Ho: There is no significant difference between the Room Rent of Hotels in non-metro cities and metro cities.
H1: The Room Rent of hotels in non-metro cities are more expensive than that in metro cities.

```{r}
t.test(cities.df$RoomRent[cities.df$IsMetroCity==0],cities.df$RoomRent[cities.df$IsMetroCity==1],alternative = "greater")
```

Inference: Since p-value<0.05, we accept H1,hence,the Room Rents of Hotels in non-metro cities is more than that of metro cities.

## Inferences:-From the above t-test,we may infer that the followinf variables are significant

1.HasSwimmingPool 
2.IsNewYearEve 
3.IsTouristDestination 
4.IsMetroCity


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
